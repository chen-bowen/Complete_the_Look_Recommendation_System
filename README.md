# Complete the Look Recommendation System

## Introduction

With the accelerated online ecommerce scene driven by the contactless shopping style in recent years, having a great recommendation system is essential to the business' success. However, it has always been challenging to provide any meaningful recommendations with the absence of user interaction history, known as the cold start problem. Our motivation is to create a cold start recommendation engine that does not need any knowledge of user preferences, user history, item propensity or any other data to recommend products to the customer. In this project, we attempted to create a comprehensive recommendation system that recommends both similar and complementary products using the power of deep learning, which would resolve the issue for lacking of user history.
